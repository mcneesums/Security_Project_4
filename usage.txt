Usage for Client Application:
	starting: java ClientApplication

	GroupServer operations:
		
	1) Type in the ip address + port of the group server, then press connect.
	2) To get a token, type your username in the top left textbox, then press Get Token
	(this enables the file server dialogue)
	3) From there, all the options on the right are available to the user.
	4) To connect to a file server, after you get the token, just put in the server name and port number
	of the server you want to connect to.
	5) Click each corresponding button depending on what you want to do.
	6) (There is a button for every action, and they are properly named, so I'm ending this here)
